# ECG Monitoring Application

This project focuses on the development of a real-time ECG monitoring system. It enables medical staff to monitor  
patients' heart activity through a web application that displays live ECG data, stores historical records, and
notifies staff when critical states are detected by an AI model.

# Preconditions

1. Node.js v22.16.0 installed

# Development

To speed up FE development HRM might be enabled:
- set the `ecg.development.hrm-enabled` property value to `true`
- execute `npm start` in terminal from `ecg-monitor-ui` subproject
